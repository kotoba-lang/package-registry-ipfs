  "Verified HTTP/IPFS transport for the pure Kotoba package registry.

  ## Why this is `.cljc` and not `.clj`

  Three imports made this namespace JVM-only — `java.net.URI`,
  `java.net.http`, and `java.time.Duration` — and all three sat inside
  `http-fetch`, the DEFAULT transport. The part that matters, and the part
  this repo exists for, is the verification: check the CID's shape before
  any I/O, check the returned bytes hash back to the CID that was asked
  for, and hand only verified bytes to
  `kotoba.lang.package-registry`. None of that is host work, and none of it
  should have pinned a caller to a runtime just because one default
  argument did.

  `fetch-fn` was already injectable, so the split costs nothing: the
  verification is shared, and the JVM `HttpClient` is a `#?(:clj …)` form
  that ClojureScript never reads.

  ## There is no portable synchronous HTTP, and this does not pretend there is

  On ClojureScript there is no default transport. `js/fetch` returns a
  promise, and this function's whole signature is synchronous — a caller
  gets `{:ok? …}` back, not a promise of one. Turning the API async to
  supply a default would change every existing caller in order to add a
  convenience.

  So on ClojureScript `fetch-fn` has no default and omitting it is a
  fail-closed `:registry/no-transport`, which is the same shape as every
  other refusal here. That is deliberately NOT the same as returning
  `{:ok? true}` with nothing fetched, and not the same as a nil-pointer
  either: a transport that could not run is a distinct answer from one that
  ran and found nothing.

  ## The byte container is the platform's

  `:bytes` in a fetch result is whatever `multiformats.core/cidv1-raw`
  hashes — a `byte[]` on the JVM and a `Uint8Array` on ClojureScript — and
  the UTF-8 decode on the way to `edn/read-string` uses the platform's own
  decoder for the same reason. `js/TextDecoder` is a global in Node and in
  browsers alike, so this does not smuggle in a Node-only dependency."
